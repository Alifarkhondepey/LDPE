# LDPE
we developed this simulation with c# and SQL server to save our data.
Using Monte Carlo Method As A Novel Stochastic
Approach For Simulation Of Exact Topological
Characteristics And Rheological Properties Of LDPE
Polymerization
A Monte Carlo method used for
simulation of LDPE polymerization processing
showing the influence of long and short-chain branches,
copolymer properties have been thoroughly studied,
and the influence of the reactivity ratios and feed
the composition has been taken into consideration.
